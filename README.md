    Implementation of Rule engine's Rete algorithm in Python

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A naive implementation of an expert system might check each rule against known facts in a knowledge base, firing that rule if necessary, then moving on to the next rule (and looping back to the first rule when finished). For even moderate sized rules and facts knowledge-bases, this naive approach performs far too slowly. The Rete algorithm provides the basis for a more efficient implementation. A Rete-based expert system builds a network of nodes, where each node (except the root) corresponds to a pattern occurring in the left-hand-side (the condition part) of a rule. The path from the root node to a leaf node defines a complete rule left-hand-side. Each node has a memory of facts which satisfy that pattern. This structure is essentially a generalized trie. As new facts are asserted or modified, they propagate along the network, causing nodes to be annotated when that fact matches that pattern. When a fact or combination of facts causes all of the patterns for a given rule to be satisfied, a leaf node is reached and the corresponding rule is triggered.

Rete was first used as the core engine of the OPS5 production system language which was used to build early systems including R1 for Digital Equipment Corporation. Rete has become the basis for many popular rule engines and expert system shells, including Tibco Business Events, Newgen OmniRules, CLIPS, Jess, Drools, IBM Operational Decision Management, OPSJ, Blaze Advisor, BizTalk Rules Engine, Soar, Clara and Sparkling Logic SMARTS. The word 'Rete' is Latin for 'net' or 'comb'. The same word is used in modern Italian to mean network. Charles Forgy has reportedly stated that he adopted the term 'Rete' because of its use in anatomy to describe a network of blood vessels and nerve fibers.[2]

The Rete algorithm is designed to sacrifice memory for increased speed. In most cases, the speed increase over na√Øve implementations is several orders of magnitude (because Rete performance is theoretically independent of the number of rules in the system). In very large expert systems, however, the original Rete algorithm tends to run into memory and server consumption problems. Other algorithms, both novel and Rete-based, have since been designed which require less memory.
